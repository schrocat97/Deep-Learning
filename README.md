# Deep-Learning
Deep Learning and Nueral Networks
This repository has .ipynb files of different Deep learning methods like ANN and CNN and also with dropout Regularization
I also added some other topics like Imbalanced Dataset Handling with 3-4 types of methods.
Do read the comments that are added on the beginning of each of the files and also beside the codes
This will help you with proper understanding of why that code was added.


In the coming few days I'll be adding more topics like Object Detection an dImage Classification using YOLO model and the COCO dataset, 
and other important topics for Computer Vision and also NLP.
